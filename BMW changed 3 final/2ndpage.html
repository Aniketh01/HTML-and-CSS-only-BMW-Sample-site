In a historic finale to the 2013 MotoGP season, Marc Marquez was crowned world champion who also became the youngest ever to win the title. He managed to beat the reigning world champion in his rookie season, becoming the second rider to achieve this feat since Kenny Roberts in 1978.

Each year, BMW sponsors the racing series and the rider with the most number of pole positions is awarded a special "BMW M Award " in the form of a latest BMW M-Series . This year, the 20 year old Marquez was awarded a truly menacing BMW M6 Coupe in Frozen Black. What a rookie season it has been for Marc with the M6 being the icing on the cake.

Hopefully, Marc can handle this powerful four wheeler as well as he does powerful two-wheels sport bikes.</p></div>
